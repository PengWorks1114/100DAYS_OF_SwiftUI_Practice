Swift gives us two ways t combine strings together;
1.join them using plus
2string interpolation

``` Swift
let firstPart = "Hello "
let secondPart = "world"
let greeting = firstPart + secondPart
let greeting2 = firstPart + secondPart + ", this is Swift"
```

``` Swift
let name = "Andy"
let age = 26
let message = "Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) yars old."
pring(message)

let number = 11
let missionMessage = "apollo" + number + "laned on the moon."
// this is nor allowed

let missionMessage = "apollo \(number) landed on the noom."

```
