Swift give us two ways to store data
depending on whether it should change over time or not.

**var**
``` Swift
import Cocoa
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
// var - means create a new variable.
// greeting - our variable's name. 
//  "Hello, playground" - initial value.
// it can vary its value can change over time.


var name = "Ted"
name = "Rebecca"
name = "Keeley"
//可以重複宣告

```

**let**
if you don't ever want to change a value,
you got to use a constant instead.
We use "let"

``` Swift
let character = "Daphne"
// this is a value that must never change

character = "Rebecca" // error
character = "Keeley" // error
```
