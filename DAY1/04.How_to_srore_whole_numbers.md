Making new int is much like making a new String.
Use let or var for constant or variable.

``` Swift
import Cocoa
let score = 10
let reallyBig = 100_100_100 // = 100100100
//Swift ignore these underbar _

let lowerScore = score - 2
let higherScore = score + 10
let doubledScore = score * 2
let squaredScore = score * score
let halvedScore = score / 2

var counter = 10
counter = counter + 5 // = counter += 5
print(counter) // 15
// We called this compound assignment operators

```
