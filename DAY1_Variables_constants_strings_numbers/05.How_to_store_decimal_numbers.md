How to store decimal numbers?

``` Swift
import Cocoa

let number = 0.1 + 0.2 // 0.3
print(number) // 0.300000000000004
// When making floating point number like we have here swift considers this to be a "double"

```

``` Swift
let a = 1 // Integer
let b = 2.0 // Double
let c = a + b
// error Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'Int' and 'Double'
```

How to fix?
``` Swift
let a = 1 // Integer
let b = 2.0 // Double
let c = a + Int(b)
let c = Double(a) + Int(b)
```
