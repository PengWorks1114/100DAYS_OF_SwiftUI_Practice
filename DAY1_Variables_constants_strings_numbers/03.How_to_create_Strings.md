``` Swift
let quote = "Then he tapped a sign saying \"Believe\" and walked away,"
//Backslash before quotes
```

swift need to handle multi-line string very carefully.

``` Swift
let movie = "A day in
the life of an
Apple engineer"
//不能擅自切行換行

//除非用下面的寫法 三個"""
let movie = """
A day in
the life of an
Apple engineer
"""
```

--介紹三種實用方法

``` Swift
import Cocoa
let actor = "Denzal Washington"
let result = "you win"
let movie = """
A day in
the life of an
Apple engineer
"""
//count
let nameLength = actor.count
print(nameLength) // 17

//uppercased
print(result.uppercased()) // 大寫

//hasPrefix
print(movie.hasPrefix("A day")) // true 確實含有A day. Becareful,swift's String is very sensetive 大小寫敏感
```
